# AdventureWorks SQL & Python Analytics Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates end-to-end analytics using the Microsoft **AdventureWorks Data Warehouse**.  
The workflow follows a realistic analytics pipeline:

**SQL (data extraction & aggregation) → Python (analysis & visualization)**

The focus is on time-series analysis, ranking, window functions, and business insight generation.

## 📊 Analysis Summary

### 1️⃣ Monthly & Cumulative Internet Sales by Country
**Business Question**  
> How do internet sales evolve over time across different countries?

**Approach**
- Aggregated monthly internet sales by country using SQL
- Created a proper time-series (`YearMonth`)
- Calculated cumulative sales using Python
- Visualized both monthly and cumulative trends

**Key Insights**
- Monthly sales highlight seasonality and short-term volatility
- Cumulative sales reveal long-term market leadership
- United States and Australia dominate overall internet sales

### 2️⃣ Top Products by Category (SQL Window Functions)
**Business Question**  
> What are the top-performing products within each product category?

**Approach**
- Joined product and category dimensions
- Aggregated sales by product
- Ranked products within each category using `RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY ...)`

**Skills Demonstrated**
- Multi-table joins
- Window functions
- Category-level ranking

### 3️⃣ Customer Revenue Concentration (Pareto Analysis)
**Business Question**  
> Is revenue concentrated among a small group of customers?

**Approach**
- Loaded customer-level sales data into Python
- Calculated cumulative revenue contribution
- Built a Pareto (80/20) analysis chart

**Key Insights**
- Revenue is not extremely concentrated among a very small group of customers.
- Approximately 80% of total revenue is generated by ~25–30% of customers, not the classic 20%.
- This indicates a moderately diversified revenue base, reducing dependency risk on a handful of top customers.
- While top customers remain important, broad customer retention and mid-tier customer growth are equally critical for sustaining revenue.
- The business is less exposed to single-customer churn risk, but optimization opportunities exist in uplifting mid-value customers.
